Run these commands from the repository root with Python 3.9 or newer. A virtual
environment is recommended.

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python tools/fetch_test_ui.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python tools/build_release.py
```

The tests use `lupa.lua51` to run the addon with simulated client APIs. Loot,
popup, action bar, and whisper tab tests also execute selected native UI code,
including the chat tab's XML double-click handler. The fetcher downloads only the nine required files from
[Gethe/wow-ui-source at the pinned commit](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/tree/70ef1b2fd78061a73f886c4a1e79dc5b5cff6d5e)
into `.test-ui/`. These external files are ignored by Git and excluded from
release archives. Fetching them requires internet access.

This suite does not run the game client, renderer, or server. Check gameplay
changes in the supported client as well. For settings changes, verify each
checkbox takes effect immediately and remains selected after `/reload` and a
restart. For range coloring, check entering and leaving range, changing targets
and action pages, insufficient resources, and switching the feature off.
For quest turn-in, check the independent toggle, Shift across conversation
pages, incomplete quests, zero/one/multiple reward choices, and quests with a
gold cost. Reward choices and native payment confirmation must remain manual.
For whisper tabs, check docked/undocked and newly opened conversations, regular
and Battle.net whispers, single/right clicks, other chat tabs, and the toggle.

The build command reads the version from `BetaQoL.toc` and creates
`dist/BetaQoL-<version>.zip`. It contains only `BetaQoL.lua`, `BetaQoL.toc`,
`README.md`, and `DEVLOG.md` inside a `BetaQoL/` folder.
